  <strong>Will Chelsea Clinton go into the family business?</strong></span>

<p class="MainText"><br>Chelsea Clinton is once again keeping the door open to a possible run for office in the future.</p><p class="MainText">
 
"I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congresswoman or either of my senators - and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know - maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer," Clinton said in an interview with Fast Company magazine.</p><p class="MainText">
 

Fast Company is a business magazine that touts itself as "uncovering innovative thinkers on the verge of breakthrough successes"</p><p class="MainText">
 
For years, when asked if she wanted to go into politics, the answer from Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter was a resounding no. But Chelsea, now 34, doesn't say no anymore, and in interviews over the past year or two has cracked open the door just a bit.</p>

<p class="MainText">Clinton's answer in the Fast Company interview was very similar to what she told CNN last August, when she was in the middle of a nine-day, six-stop African trip with her father for the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Foundation.</p><p  class="MainText">
 
"I'm grateful to live in a city and a state and a country where I really believe in my elected officials, and their ethos and their competencies," Clinton told CNN's Nima Elbagir, in Rwanda. "Someday, if either of those weren't true, and I thought I could make more of a difference in the public sector, or if I didn't like how my city or state or country were being run, I'd have to ask and answer that question."</p><p  class="MainText">

 Clinton, who lives in New York City, gave a similar answer to NBC last April.</p><p  class="MainText">
 
A media report a couple of years ago mentioned her as a possible congressional candidate, but the report was quickly shot down by Clinton world.</p><p  class="MainText">
 
Former President Bill Clinton said last year that his wife would be a better president right now but in the long term, it's all about Chelsea. Clinton was responding to a question from CNN's Piers Morgan about who would be the better President, Hillary or Chelsea.</p><p  class="MainText">
 
"Day after tomorrow, my wife because she's had more experience. Over the long run, Chelsea. She knows more than we do about everything," Clinton said in an interview last September.
