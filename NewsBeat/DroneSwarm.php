  <strong>A Swarm of Drones is Buzzing Your Way</strong></span>

<p class="MainText">The annual Hong Kong Toy and Games Fair bills itself as Asia's "biggest toys event" and provides a chance for manufacturers, particularly those from mainland China, to showcase their very newest designs, take orders from the world's largest toy companies, and then line up their manufacturing schedule for the year. What's hot at Hong Kong toy fair is often an indicator of what toys will be best-sellers in the year ahead, and particularly at the all important Christmas season.</p><p class="MainText">

Judging by the wares on display, 2015 will be the year of the super-cheap camera-equipped drone, capable of traveling up to several hundred meters and priced so low that consumers could potentially buy them for $100 or less.</p><p  class="MainText">

While drones in general were a hot holiday gift in 2014, this year's newest models fly farther and easier, take clearer photos, and cost much, much less.</p>

<p class="MainText">Huajun Aeromodelling in Guangdong, a helicopter-turned-drone manufacturing specialist, has a spidery-looking six-legged camera drone that carries a HD camera, flies for 500 meters and has a "FPV" (for first person view) screen so you can see what it's filming &ndash; price $46. A smaller four-legged camera drone, without the FPV option or the HD camera, goes for $15.60.</p><p  class="MainText">

The flood of inexpensive, camera-carrying drones is sure to be welcomed by tech enthusiasts who don't want to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a professional-grade aerial photography kit &ndash; but they could also create plenty of problems. After all, they present plenty of ways for users to observe the world, without having to actually be that close to other individuals &ndash; from the pesky "harass your older sister in her room" to the potentially illegal "spying on your neighbor who is having an affair" to just cruising over a beach crowd that doesn't want to be filmed.</p><p  class="MainText">

Most governments have yet to pass any laws on personal camera drones, besides banning their use in or near airports. The British government's advice to users, which mostly amounts to "use good judgment" and "try not to make anyone angry" is pretty standard (although California is one exception). As this swarm touches down around the world, expect some ugly confrontations between man and machine. </p>
