<p class="MainText"><br>President Obama has been sounding the alarm to Democrats about the midterm elections. He's trying to energize the base, warning that Democrats get "clobbered" in midterm elections and urging a major push to get people to the polls.</p><p class="MainText">

At a Houston fundraiser Wednesday night &ndash at a mansion with a pool flanked by palm trees, which a reporter there described as "a sight from Versailles" &ndash Obama lambasted the amount of money that Republicans were pouring into super PACs and what he believes are deliberate efforts to dissuade Democrats from voting.</p>

<p class="MainText">"And what's compounding the problem is obviously the massive amounts of money that are coming from super PACs on the other side and active efforts to discourage people from voting &ndash which is another thing I don't understand but apparently is fairly active here in Texas. The idea that you'd purposely try to prevent people from voting," Obama said.</p><p  class="MainText">

"Un-American," Obama said. "How is it that we're putting up with that when we don't have to? But it requires a level of organization and a level of effort that has to be coordinated and has to be executed.  And that's why your presence here tonight is so important. We need you to take these midterms as seriously as any presidential election that you've ever been involved in."</p><p  class="MainText">

It's been a big month for the intersection of money and politics. The Supreme Court struck down aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and political committees, a sweeping decision with far-reaching implications. Regardless of party, a lot more money will be flowing.</p><p  class="MainText">

A new Pew Research Center poll is the latest indicator of how little attention people pay to campaign finance matters. It also underscores the challenge Democrats face this year as they seek to make the billionaire Koch brothers into an electoral issue. About half the public (49 percent) said they didn't follow the Supreme Court decision closely at all.</p><p  class="MainText">

Democrats feel like if they can tie Republican candidates to the policies favored by the Koch brothers rather than the process story of money and politics, they will stand a better chance of making voters see those candidates as villains. Overall, it's going to be a very tall task.
